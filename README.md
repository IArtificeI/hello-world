# hello-world
My first repository.

My name is Artifice. I am currently learning how to use github (reference: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). I do not know the first thing about the programming world (or anything in the IT community in that matter), but I hope that learning taking the steps to learn how to use Github will help me with that.
